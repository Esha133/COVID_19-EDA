#  COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – India

##  Project Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a COVID-19 dataset for India.
The aim is to understand the **spread of COVID-19 across Indian states**, including trends in **confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths**, using basic data analysis and visualization techniques.

This project is designed for **beginner-level data analytics learning**.

##  Dataset

* **Dataset Name:** COVID-19 India Dataset
* **Source:** Publicly available COVID-19 data
* **Data Type:** Daily cumulative records

### Key Columns Used

* `date` – Date of record
* `state_ut` – State / Union Territory
* `confirmed` – Total confirmed cases (cumulative)
* `cured` – Total recovered cases (cumulative)
* `deaths` – Total deaths (cumulative)

 *Note:* The dataset contains **cumulative data**, meaning values represent totals up to a given date.

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – Data manipulation
* **NumPy** – Numerical operations
* **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook**

##  Steps Performed in the Project

1. Imported required Python libraries
2. Loaded the COVID-19 dataset
3. Performed basic data understanding (`shape`, `info`, `tail`)
4. Cleaned the dataset by removing unnecessary columns
5. Cleaned inconsistent state names
6. Understood and handled cumulative data correctly
7. Analyzed state-wise total confirmed cases
8. Analyzed state-wise deaths and recoveries
9. Identified top states by confirmed cases
10. Visualized trends using bar charts and line charts
11. Analyzed daily trends of confirmed, recovered, and death cases

---

##  Visualizations Included

* Top states by confirmed COVID-19 cases (Bar Chart)
* State-wise deaths and recoveries
* Daily trend of confirmed cases
* Daily trend of recovered cases
* Daily trend of death cases

Simple visualizations were chosen to maintain **clarity and readability**.

---

##  Key Observations

* COVID-19 cases increased steadily over time
* A small number of states contributed most of the total cases
* Recoveries increased alongside confirmed cases
* Death counts were lower compared to recoveries

## Conclusion

This EDA project provides meaningful insights into the spread of COVID-19 in India using basic data analysis techniques.
The project demonstrates essential skills such as data cleaning, grouping, handling cumulative data, and visualization, making it a strong **beginner-level data analytics project**.
